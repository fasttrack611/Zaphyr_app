Key Implementation Notes:

Idle Time Measurement:

Uses execution cycles of idle threads

Calculates utilization: 100% - (idle_time / total_time)

Thread Migration:

Changes CPU affinity masks

Preserves original affinity constraints

Uses kernel thread monitor API for iteration

CPU-bound Task Detection:

Prioritizes threads with highest runtime

Skips threads with essential flag

Ignores sleeping/waiting threads

Scheduler Integration:

Runs at lower priority than application threads

Minimal overhead during normal operation

Safe interaction with scheduler APIs

This implementation provides dynamic load balancing while maintaining system stability. The balancer thread has minimal overhead and automatically adapts to changing workload conditions in SMP systems.
