Explanation: What Is k_cpu_idle()?
k_cpu_idle() tells Zephyr that the CPU can safely enter an idle state until an interrupt occurs.

This is typically used inside idle loops, low-priority background threads, or periods when no work is pending.

The CPU is halted or put into a low-power mode depending on platform and configuration.

It's different from k_sleep() which explicitly suspends a thread for a duration.

ðŸ”‹ Use Case: Power-Sensitive Systems
Scenario	Benefit of k_cpu_idle()
Sensor polling loop	Save power between samples
Background thread	Yield CPU until next event
No active workloads	Let device drop into sleep


CONFIG_PM=y
CONFIG_PM_CPU_IDLE=y



k_cpu_idle(): CPU-Level Power Hint
Attribute	Description
ðŸ§  Purpose	Tells the kernel it's safe to idle the CPU, but does not block the thread.
âš¡ Behavior	Enters a low-power state until an interrupt occurs.
ðŸ§µ Thread effect	The calling thread continues running right after wakeup.
ðŸ”§ Use Case	When your thread has nothing to do and wants to yield CPU temporarily without a scheduled sleep.
Example:
c
k_cpu_idle();  // CPU halts until next interrupt (e.g., timer, GPIO, etc.)
Typically used in custom idle loops or low-priority background threads.

It mimics what the idle thread does automatically when no tasks are runnable.

ðŸ›Œ k_sleep(duration): Thread-Level Delay
Attribute	Description
ðŸ§  Purpose	Puts the calling thread to sleep for a specified duration.
ðŸ§µ Thread effect	The thread is blocked/suspended and cannot run until timeout expires.
âš¡ Behavior	Thread is removed from the ready queue. Scheduler may switch to other threads or idle state.
ðŸ”§ Use Case	When you want to delay execution predictably and free the CPU for other work.
Example:
c
k_sleep(K_MSEC(1000));  // Thread sleeps for 1000 milliseconds
Ideal for pacing tasks, timeouts, or passive waits.

ðŸ§  Key Differences
Feature	k_cpu_idle()	k_sleep()
Power hint	Yes (can reduce CPU usage)	Indirect (via scheduling)
Thread block	No (thread continues instantly)	Yes (thread is suspended)
Wake trigger	Interrupt-based	Time-based
Return timing	Unpredictable	After set duration
Use case	Manual idle hint	Controlled wait/delay
ðŸ§© Real-Time Tip
You can use both together:

c
while (true) {
    if (no_pending_work()) {
        k_cpu_idle();  // Save power
    } else {
        k_sleep(K_MSEC(500));  // Handle batching every 500ms
    }
}
