Priority Inheritance Demo on Zephyr (QEMU x86)
==============================================
LOW Thread STARTED (Prio: 5)
LOW Locking mutex...
LOW Mutex acquired. Current priority: 5
HIGH Thread STARTED (Prio: 3)
HIGH Attempting to lock mutex...
LOW Priority after inheritance: 3 (expected 3)
MED Thread STARTED (Prio: 4)
LOW Doing work while holding mutex...
LOW Working 1/3 (should NOT be preempted by MED)
LOW Working 2/3 (should NOT be preempted by MED)

LOW Releasing mutex
HIGH Acquired mutex! Executing critical section...
HIGH Releasing mutex
HIGH FINISHED
LOW Priority after release: 5 (expected 5)
LOW FINISHED
MED Thread executing (should NOT run during critical section!)
MED FINISHED

Test Summary:
- Priority inheritance SUCCESS
- Final priority restoration SUCCESS
Demo complete. Halting QEMU.
```

**Key Implementation Details:**

1. **Priority Inheritance Mechanism:**
   - When high-priority thread blocks on mutex owned by low-priority thread
   - Zephyr automatically boosts owner's priority to match highest waiter
   - Original priority is restored when mutex is released

2. **Synchronization Flow:**
   1. Low-prio thread acquires mutex
   2. High-prio thread starts and blocks on mutex
   3. System boosts low-prio thread to high-prio level
   4. Medium-prio thread starts but cannot preempt
   5. Low-prio completes critical section and releases mutex
   6. High-prio acquires mutex and completes
   7. Priority is restored to low-prio thread

3. **Anti-Starvation Features:**
   - Medium-priority thread cannot preempt low-prio during critical section
   - Busy-wait work simulation prevents accidental yielding
   - Explicit priority checks validate inheritance behavior

4. **Verification Mechanisms:**
   - Priority level checks before/during/after critical section
   - Flag to detect if medium thread executed during critical period
   - Final validation of priority restoration

**Testing Priority Inversion Prevention:**
1. Without priority inheritance:
   - Medium thread would preempt low thread
   - High thread would be blocked indefinitely
   - System would experience priority inversion

2. With priority inheritance:
   - Low thread temporarily inherits high priority
   - Medium thread cannot preempt
   - Critical section completes without unnecessary delays

This implementation demonstrates Zephyr's built-in priority inheritance mechanism, showing how it solves priority inversion problems in real-time systems. The QEMU x86 environment provides a convenient platform for testing RTOS behavior without physical hardware.
